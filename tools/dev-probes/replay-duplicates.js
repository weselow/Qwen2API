/**
 * replay-duplicates.js — does the model actually stop repeating itself?
 *
 * The synthetic probe (probe-agent-loop.js) cannot answer that. Its cells B and
 * C already passed BEFORE the correlation fix landed — C passed vacuously,
 * because the model emitted no calls at all. A probe with no headroom cannot
 * measure a fix. Static analysis shows the addressing information is now present
 * for 100% of duplicate cases; it does not show the model uses it.
 *
 * This harness replays real history instead of inventing it. A recorded Claude
 * Code session that ran through this proxy is a natural experiment: at every
 * point where the model re-issued a call it had already made, we know what the
 * real model did with that exact context. Replay the prefix, look at what comes
 * back now.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MEASURED 2026-09-08 — READ THIS BEFORE SPENDING A SINGLE REQUEST.
 *
 * THE PRE-FIX ARM DOES NOT REPRODUCE THE BUG. 24 upstream requests, qwen3.8-max,
 * pre-fix service at 309da59 (no numbering, no ledger) and post-fix at 785486d:
 *
 *   arm        stratum                                  REPEATED  tool-emission
 *   pre-fix    95b7b0c1, budget 48, collisions p50=6       0/8          100%
 *   pre-fix    33f8544e, budget 90, collisions p50=44      0/8          100%
 *   post-fix   95b7b0c1, the same 8 byte-identical cells   0/8          100%
 *
 * The null is NOT the vacuous one that made probe cell C worthless. Tool-emission
 * was 100% in every arm: the model engaged on every cell and chose a DIFFERENT
 * call. The instrument was audited against this exact failure mode — prefixSigs
 * held 20-52 signatures per cell and the about-to-be-repeated signature WAS in
 * the set, so a repeat would have been caught. The absence is real.
 *
 * WHY, STRUCTURALLY. Repetition lives in a context regime this replay cannot
 * reach. 100% of runnable onsets are WINDOWED: 0 of 99 fitting onsets in
 * 95b7b0c1 and 4 of 94 in 33f8544e survive as a full prefix even at the 90 KiB
 * ceiling, and those 4 have gap<=6 and collisions<=3 — no headroom by
 * construction. The recorded prefixes run to ~340 KiB, and above 90 KiB the
 * proxy externalises context into an uploaded document, which is a different
 * subsystem. So the window is not a tunable: it is forced, and it removes the
 * accumulated task state. It shows in the output — pre-fix cells answered with
 * `cd … && ls package.json` and `cat package.json`, i.e. the model RE-ORIENTING
 * in a repo it no longer has the history for, not continuing the paging loop
 * that produced the duplicate. MOVED_ON here does not mean "correctly used the
 * numbered result"; it means the replay put the model in a different behavioural
 * regime from the one that was recorded.
 *
 * WHAT THE 24 REQUESTS DID BUY, and it is not nothing:
 *   - No regression, two-sided. 8/8 concordant pairs, discordant b=0 c=0. The
 *     pre-registered upward direction (the ledger PRIMING repeats by printing
 *     the exact strings) did not materialise on this sample.
 *   - The lazy-model risk did not materialise either. The anti-repetition rule
 *     was predicted to buy a fake win by making the model call fewer tools;
 *     instead the post-fix arm emitted MORE calls than pre-fix (11 vs 9) at
 *     identical tool-emission, so the raw metric was not being flattered.
 *   - Prompt cost, measured on real agentic requests rather than a synthetic
 *     one: +6679 input tokens across 8 cells, +15.8% versus pre-fix on
 *     byte-identical request bodies. Larger than the +12.7% measured on a bare
 *     prompt, because the ledger grows with tool history. Any further prompt
 *     growth pays this multiplier on EVERY request.
 *   - Zero protocol residue and zero errors in either arm.
 *
 * DO NOT run the paired A/B on this design expecting a duplicate-rate number.
 * It would spend 40+ requests comparing 0% against 0%. To get headroom, the
 * replay has to keep the full recorded prefix, which means either measuring
 * ON the externalisation path deliberately (a different subject, with its own
 * invariant) or capturing fresh sessions against a live proxy instead of
 * replaying windowed ones. Until one of those exists, the duplicate-rate claim
 * stays UNPROVEN, and that is the honest state to leave it in.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PRE-REGISTRATION. Fill this in BEFORE spending a request, and do not revise it
 * afterwards. The test is TWO-SIDED. The ledger prints the exact command strings
 * that count as REPEATED, so it is a plausible PRIMING mechanism: REPEATED going
 * UP is a real possible outcome and must not be re-narrated as noise.
 *
 *   H0   post-fix repeat rate == pre-fix repeat rate
 *   H1   post-fix repeat rate != pre-fix repeat rate      (two-sided)
 *   Primary metric   REPEATED / (REPEATED + MOVED_ON)   — see METRIC below
 *   Test             McNemar exact on discordant pairs, two-sided, alpha 0.05
 *   Decision rule    Report the point estimate, the discordant counts b/c and
 *                    the exact p. With the cluster structure below, treat a
 *                    p-value as descriptive, never as proof.
 *
 * POWER, STATED HONESTLY. McNemar on n=20 needs ~9 of 10 discordant pairs to
 * move the same way to clear 0.05. A genuine 50%->25% halving returns
 * NON-significant at that n. Worse, the onsets are not independent draws: in
 * both reference sessions the majority of eligible onsets touch ONE file
 * (lohari 68% AssignmentWizardShell.tsx, qwen2api 80% anthropic.js), so the
 * effective number of independent situations is closer to the distinct-target
 * count than to the scenario count. --per-target exists to attack exactly this
 * and the run prints the realised cluster count. Read that number before
 * believing any p-value.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A DUPLICATE-ONSET POINT
 *
 *   cross  (default) call[i] is byte-identical (name + canonical arguments) to
 *          some earlier call[j], and the message before call[i] is the user
 *          message carrying tool_result. The replayed prefix therefore ends at
 *          exactly the decision point where the real model chose to repeat.
 *   strict            call[i] is byte-identical to call[i-1] — the model called,
 *          got the result, and immediately re-issued the same call.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A NUMBER. In each reference transcript there is
 * roughly ONE strict-immediate onset and ~170 eligible cross onsets. The figure
 * "326 immediate repeats" is a whole-corpus number (192 sessions, 15,337 calls),
 * not a property of any one file. `--mode strict` here has a sample size of ~1
 * and is useful only as a spot check; `--mode cross` is the arm with statistical
 * power, and it is the default.
 *
 * CHOOSING A TRANSCRIPT — THE POPULATION IS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT.
 * Root cause 1 (the headline numbering fix) addresses results that cannot be
 * told apart: N calls to the same tool whose results all read `[TOOL RESULT:
 * <name>]`. A session whose repeats are "Bash returned nothing, try again" is
 * a retry-after-empty-output loop and the numbering fix is inapplicable to it
 * BY CONSTRUCTION. Measured over the eligible-and-fitting onsets of each
 * candidate (`--dry-run --profile` reprints this for any transcript):
 *
 *   session                       fits  decision tool   empty results  ledger live
 *   95b7b0c1 (Qwen2API)  DEFAULT    90  Read 76/Bash 14           7%        18/20
 *   33f8544e (lohari)               81  Bash 69/Read 10          63%        11/20
 *
 * The default is the Read-heavy one: it is the population the fix is aimed at,
 * and its ledger survives the byte cap far more often. The lohari session stays
 * available as a SECOND, SEPARATELY REPORTED stratum — it has more same-name
 * ambiguity but the wrong failure mechanism. NEVER POOL THEM: run the harness
 * once per transcript and report two numbers. Note also that lohari's transcript
 * is contaminated by somebody else's treatment — 7 of its tool_results carry an
 * external "Wasted call — file unchanged since your last Read" hook message.
 *
 * WINDOWING. A late-session prefix is ~340 KiB, far past the 90 KiB threshold
 * at which the proxy externalises context into an uploaded document. That path
 * is not what we are measuring here. So: if the full prefix fits the budget it
 * is sent verbatim; otherwise the request is the first user message (the task)
 * followed by a contiguous tail beginning at the assistant message that carries
 * call[j]. That window always contains the earlier identical call AND the result
 * that answered it, which is the whole precondition for calling a repeat a
 * repeat. Every record says which shape it used, so a sceptic can split on it.
 *
 * THE BUDGET FILTER IS NOT NEUTRAL. `gap` (calls between the original and the
 * repeat) is the DOSE — how much ambiguous history the model must see through —
 * and it correlates with prefix size, so the byte budget preferentially discards
 * the high-dose onsets. Measured: lohari eligible gap p50=94 -> fitting p50=25;
 * qwen2api eligible p50=41 -> fitting p50=12. The experiment therefore studies
 * the EASY half of the population and understates any dose-dependent effect.
 * `--strata gap` spreads the sample across the surviving gap quartiles so at
 * least the retained range is covered evenly; it cannot resurrect what the
 * budget dropped. Raise `--budget` (ceiling 90) to keep more.
 *
 * CLASSIFICATION (exactly one per scenario-trial)
 *   REPEATED   emitted a tool_use byte-identical to a call already answered in
 *              the replayed prefix
 *   MOVED_ON   emitted tool_use, none of them a repeat
 *   ANSWERED   text only, no tool_use
 *   TRUNCATED  the turn hit the output cap — see below; excluded from both
 *              denominators because a turn cut off mid-emission has not chosen
 *   ERROR      non-2xx or unparseable — status and body recorded
 *
 * TRUNCATED IS KEYED ON TOKENS, NOT ON stop_reason, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
 * `stop_reason` is itself under test: the truncation-precedence fix makes a cut
 * off tool turn report `max_tokens` where the pre-fix build reports `tool_use`.
 * Keying the verdict on it would let a fix under test change the classification,
 * biasing the very comparison this harness exists to make. `usage.output_tokens`
 * is untouched by that fix, so the cap test is arm-independent. `stopReason` is
 * still recorded, so the disagreement can be audited.
 *
 * METRIC. The headline is REPEATED / (REPEATED + MOVED_ON): of the turns where
 * the model chose to call something, how often was the choice a repeat. The raw
 * REPEATED/all is ALSO printed but is confounded — it falls if the model merely
 * stops calling tools, and the post-fix prompt contains a rule pushing that way,
 * so a lazier model would score as a win. The tool-emission rate is printed
 * separately for exactly that reason.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU, STATED FOR THE RECORD
 *   - ANSWERED conflates "correctly reused the earlier result" (the win) with
 *     "gave up" and with "emitted a call the parser failed to lift". The `residue`
 *     field and the full `text` are recorded so the three can be separated BY
 *     HAND; nothing here does it automatically. In particular an answer sourced
 *     from the WRONG numbered result still scores ANSWERED, and that is the most
 *     important failure mode the numbering fix could introduce.
 *   - A repeat is not always wrong: re-reading a file after editing it is
 *     correct. `mutationBetween` records whether a state-changing call ran
 *     between j and i so those cells can be split out. It is rare in both
 *     reference sessions (lohari 3/81, qwen2api 6/90) but it is not zero.
 *   - No system prompt is sent and the tool schemas are reconstructed from
 *     observed inputs (generic descriptions, no `required`). Both arms get
 *     byte-identical requests so INTERNAL validity holds, but the absolute
 *     rates are not Claude Code's rates and must never be reported as such.
 *
 * Selection is deterministic: no RNG anywhere. The same invocation picks the
 * same scenarios on every run and in every arm, which is the only way the
 * pre-fix and post-fix numbers are comparable.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/dev-probes/replay-duplicates.js --dry-run --profile   (no spend)
 *
 *   # pilot: pre-fix arm only, learn whether the bug reproduces at all
 *   BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3010 KEY=sk-... MODEL=qwen3.8-max \
 *     node tools/dev-probes/replay-duplicates.js --limit 6 --out pilot.jsonl
 *
 *   # paired, interleaved: A and B alternate per scenario, same bytes both ways
 *   BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3010 BASE_URL_B=http://127.0.0.1:3011 \
 *   KEY=sk-... MODEL=qwen3.8-max \
 *     node tools/dev-probes/replay-duplicates.js --limit 24 --out paired.jsonl
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --transcript FILE  JSONL session to replay (default: the Qwen2API session)
 *   --mode cross|strict
 *   --limit N          scenarios to run (default 20)
 *   --seed-offset K    rotate the deterministic selection (default 0)
 *   --max-calls N      ceiling on SCENARIOS (default 30); applied during
 *                      selection, so a lowered ceiling still yields a spread
 *   --strata gap|none  spread the sample across gap quartiles (default gap)
 *   --per-target N     max scenarios sharing one target file (default 3, 0=off)
 *   --prefer-collisions  break ties toward onsets with the most same-name
 *                      different-argument calls in between (default on)
 *   --repeat N         trials per scenario per arm (default 1). >1 gives a
 *                      within-arm noise floor and more chances to catch the bug
 *   --budget KIB       per-request byte budget (default 48, threshold is 90)
 *   --result-cap N     truncate each tool_result body to N chars (default 1200)
 *   --think-cap N      truncate each thinking block to N chars (default 400)
 *   --no-thinking      drop inbound thinking blocks entirely
 *   --max-tokens N     response cap (default 2048)
 *   --stream           use the streaming path (what production actually uses)
 *   --out FILE         write one JSONL record per scenario-trial-arm
 *   --dry-run          print the selection and shapes, send nothing
 *   --profile          with --dry-run, print the population profile and exit
