/**
 * Test-count gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `node --test --test-force-exit` under-reports, silently.
 *
 * Node propagates `--test-force-exit` to the CHILD process it spawns per test
 * file (confirmed: it appears in the child's `process.execArgv`). When a child
 * finishes it calls `process.exit()`, which does NOT flush stdout that is still
 * buffered — and a child's stdout is a pipe to the runner, which is async on
 * POSIX. Whatever had not reached the pipe is discarded. The parent counts only
 * what it received, sees no failure, and exits 0.
 *
 * Reproduced with zero project code: two trivial test files (3000 tests + 3
 * tests), `--test-force-exit`, 5 runs -> one run reported 3000 instead of 3003,
 * `fail 0`, exit 0. The 3-test file vanished whole. Without `--test-force-exit`
 * the same pair reported 3003 every time.
 *
 * We cannot simply drop `--test-force-exit`: 26 of this repo's 43 test files
 * never exit without it (module-load `setInterval`s in `src/utils/account.js`,
 * reached through `src/utils/chat-helpers.js`, keep the loop alive), so the run
 * hangs forever instead of finishing short.
 *
 * So the gate does not use the parent runner at all. Every test file runs in
 * its own node process with `--test-isolation=none` (the tests execute in that
 * very process — there is no runner child underneath whose pipe could be cut)
 * plus `--test-force-exit`; the gate reads each process's stdout to EOF before
 * it counts anything, and the per-file summaries are summed. That sum is then
 * checked against a committed baseline: short is a failure, never a pass. A
 * short attempt is still retried — a genuinely deleted test is short on EVERY
 * attempt while a flake is not — and if it stays short the gate exits non-zero
 * and says so loudly.
 *
 * Why the parent runner had to go (2026-09-11): on GitHub's 2-vCPU runner it
 * came back short on 3 of 3 attempts for a tree that was whole (1035 of 1074,
 * fail 0, exit 0), each time missing the TAIL of different files. Reproduced
 * on a 4-core VPS by adding CPU load (1069, then 1074 on the retry). The loss
 * is load-dependent, and CI is always loaded.
